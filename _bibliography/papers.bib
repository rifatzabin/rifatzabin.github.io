  title={An IoT based efficient waste collection system with smart bins},
  abstract={Waste collection and management is an integrated
  part of both city and village life. Lack of optimized and efficient
  waste collection system vastly affect public health and costs
  more. The prevailing traditional waste collection system is neither
  optimized nor efficient. Internet of Things (IoT) has been playing
  a great role in making human life easier by making systems
  smart, adequate and self-sufficient. Thus, this paper proposes an
  IoT based efficient waste collection system with smart bins. It
  does real-time monitoring of the waste bins and determines which
  bins are to emptied in every cycle of waste collection. The system
  also presents an enhanced navigation system that shows the best
  route to collect wastes from the selected bins. Four waste bins
  are assumed in the city of Mount Pleasant, Michigan at random
  location. The proposed system decreases the travel distance by
  30.76% on an average in the assumed scenario, compared to the
  traditional waste collection system. Thus it reduces the fuel cost
  and human labor making the system optimized and efficient by
  enabling real-time monitoring and enhanced navigation},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
