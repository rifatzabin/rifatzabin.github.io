  title={An IoT based efficient waste collection system with smart bins},
  abstract={Waste collection and management is an integrated
  part of both city and village life. Lack of optimized and efficient
  waste collection system vastly affect public health and costs
  more. The prevailing traditional waste collection system is neither
  optimized nor efficient. Internet of Things (IoT) has been playing
  a great role in making human life easier by making systems
  smart, adequate and self-sufficient. Thus, this paper proposes an
  IoT based efficient waste collection system with smart bins. It
  does real-time monitoring of the waste bins and determines which
  bins are to emptied in every cycle of waste collection. The system
  also presents an enhanced navigation system that shows the best
  route to collect wastes from the selected bins. Four waste bins
  are assumed in the city of Mount Pleasant, Michigan at random
  location. The proposed system decreases the travel distance by
  30.76% on an average in the assumed scenario, compared to the
  traditional waste collection system. Thus it reduces the fuel cost
  and human labor making the system optimized and efficient by
  enabling real-time monitoring and enhanced navigation},

  abstract={To meet the increased demand of electricity, PV system is being used as home RES (Renewable Energy Source) throughout the world. In this paper, a grid integrated PV system has been proposed with net metering scheme. A home of 149 sq. meter in Dhaka city is considered whose average daily load is 11.27 kWh/day with an annual peak load of 1.21 kW. According to DESCO (Dhaka Electric Supply Company Limited), for the span of last one year (July, 2017-July, 2018) the monthly electricity usage of this home varies from 401-600 units (kWh) with a Cost of Energy (COE) of $0.1. Simulation and analysis of the proposed system shows that the Cost of Energy (COE) and Net present Cost (NPC) of the proposed system can be reduced to a great extent with the application of net metering scheme which also improves the renewable fraction of the system.},

abstract={The increase of consumer end load demand is leading to a path to the smart handling of power sector utility. In recent era, the civilization has reached to such a pinnacle of technology that there is no scope of energy wastage. Consequently, questions arise on power generation sector. To prevent both electricity shortage and wastage, electrical load forecasting becomes the most convenient way out. Artificial Intelligent, Conventional and Probabilistic methods are employed in load forecasting. However the conventional and probabilistic methods are less adaptive to the acute, micro and unusual change of the demand trend. With the recent development of Artificial intelligence, machine learning has become the most popular choice due to its higher accuracy based on time, demand and trend based feature extractions. Even though machine learning based models have got the potential, most of the contemporary research works lack in precise and factual feature extractions which results in lower accuracy and higher convergence time. Thus the proposed model takes into account the extensive features derived from both long and short time lag based auto-correlation. Also, for an accurate prediction from these extracted features two Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) Regression based models: (i) PredXGBR-1 and (ii) PredXGBR-2 have been proposed with definite short time lag feature to predict hourly load demand. The proposed model is validated with five different historical data record of various zonal area over a twenty years of-2 time span. The average accuracy (ùëÖ2
) of PredXGBR-1 and PredXGBR-2 are 61.721% and 99.0982% with an average MAPE (error) of 8.095% and 0.9101% respectively.},

  abstract={Zigbee is a short-range wireless communication standard that is based on IEEE 802.15.4 and is vastly used in both indoor and outdoor Internet of Things (IoT) applications. One of the basic constraints of Zigbee and similar wireless sensor networks (WSN) standards is limited power source as in most of the cases they are battery powered. Thus, it is very important to optimize the energy consumption to have a good network lifetime. Even though tuning the power transmission level to a lower value might make the network more energy efficient, it also hampers the network performances very badly. This work aims to optimize the energy consumption by finding the right balance and trade-off between the transmission power level and network performance through extensive experimental analysis. Packet delivery ratio (PDR) is taken into account for evaluating the network performance. This work also presents a performance analysis of both the encrypted and unencrypted Zigbee with the stated metrics in a real-world testbed, deployed in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. The major contribution of this work includes (i) to optimize the energy consumption by evaluating the most optimized transmission power level of Zigbee where the network performance is also good in terms of PDR (ii) identifying and quantizing the trade-offs of PDR, transmission power levels, current and energy consumption (iii) creating an indoor and outdoor Zigbee testbed based on commercially available Zigbee module XBee S2C to perform any sort of extensive performance analysis.},
